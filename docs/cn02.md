# Docker Swarm运行Spring Cloud（二）：Eureka高可用





## Run in production environment

All in one is good, but you need to consider below factors when you want to run all the services in an production environment.

- deploy Eureka server and applications separately, as Eureka server as an infrasturcture level service will not be updated frequently, it is not proper to deploy it with applications every time the application changes.
- again, Eureka server as infrastructure level need some kind of HA (high availablity).



Let's break the deployment into two compose files. Using [eureka.yml](compose/eureka.yml) you can deply a three-node-cluster of Euerka. All instances have same network alias ```eureka``` for which Eureka client will looking for.  

[eureka.yml](compose/eureka.yml)

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  eureka1:
    image: binblee/demo-eurekaserver
    networks:
      springcloud-overlay:
        aliases:
          - eureka
    ports:
      - "8761:8761"
    environment:
      - ADDITIONAL_EUREKA_SERVER_LIST=http://eureka2:8761/eureka/,http://eureka3:8761/eureka/
    ...
  eureka2:
    image: binblee/demo-eurekaserver
    networks:
      springcloud-overlay:
        aliases:
          - eureka
    ports:
      - "8762:8761"
    environment:
      - ADDITIONAL_EUREKA_SERVER_LIST=http://eureka1:8761/eureka/,http://eureka3:8761/eureka/
    ...
  eureka3:
    image: binblee/demo-eurekaserver
    networks:
      springcloud-overlay:
        aliases:
          - eureka
    ports:
      - "8763:8761"
    environment:
      - ADDITIONAL_EUREKA_SERVER_LIST=http://eureka1:8761/eureka/,http://eureka3:8761/eureka/
    ...
networks:
  springcloud-overlay:
    external:
      name: springcloud-overlay
```



[demoweb.yml](compose/demoweb.yml) gets the content from original [all-in-one.yml](compose/all-in-one.yml), adding network properties. All services will connect to ```springcloud-overlay``` network.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: binblee/demo-web
    networks:
      - springcloud-overlay
    environment:
      - EUREKA_SERVER_ADDRESS=eureka
    ports:
      - "8080"
    ...

  bookservice:
    image: binblee/demo-bookservice
    networks:
      - springcloud-overlay
    environment:
      - EUREKA_SERVER_ADDRESS=eureka
    ...

networks:
  springcloud-overlay:
    external:
      name: springcloud-overlay
```



Let's deploy it, noted that ```springcloud-overlay``` network needs to be created before ```eureka``` and ```demoweb``` are deployed.

```bash
docker network create -d overlay springcloud-overlay
cd compose/
docker stack deploy -c eureka.yml
docker stack deploy -c demoweb.yml
```



Access port 8761 of any node in swarm, you will see Eureka instance #1 has two replicas, and services are registered to it. Visit port 8761 and 8763, you will get other two Eureka server, have a try.
